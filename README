About
--------
write an encrypted worriedArchive to disc.
will keep track of which files already written on other disc and only write the new ones. (optional)

cd not supported. support could easily be added with a few more libburn api calls but anybody using cd is a maniac.

to decrypt and extract a disc you've made using the worriedArchive goodextract.out program:
	gpg -d /dev/sr0 | ./goodextract.out - ./destfolder

--------
Format of the disc image v1:
--------
<gpg encrypted worried archive>
<0x00> (this can be recognized because no pgp tag header can start without bit 7 set or with tag id 0.)
"ROUNDEND" (ASCII)
<uint8_t roundArchiveVersion> (this is defined in roundFormat.h and is currently (02/08/20) 0x01.)
<uint64_t discNumber>
<uint32_t: crc32 of encrypted worried archive>
uint64_t numPacketBackupData
(numPacketBackupData) bytes of packet headers

packet header backup:
<packet header>
<a byte>
   // if this byte is 0x01 then the packet's contents follow
   // if this byte is 0x00 then then the packet's contents do not follow
   // if this byte is >0x01 then read the next byte
		// (note that this will only happen for partial length headers)
		// the first byte and the second byte come together to form a BIG endian uint16_t with bit 7 (leftmost) of the first byte ignored.
		// this number represents the number of packets in a row with this partial length.
		// to get the big endian bits, do ((a & 0x7f) << 8) | b
